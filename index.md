Project Overview: SAVN.local Virtual Network Implementation

"SAVN.local" is a virtual private network (VPN) designed for a fictitious company called System Administration Virtual Network Company (SAVN). As the company’s system administrator, I am responsible for designing and implementing this network. SAVN’s network infrastructure will be built using Microsoft technologies, specifically Windows Server 2022 for servers and Windows 10 for desktop environments.




# Managing the SAVN.local Domain

Project Overview: In this project, I managed the SAVN.local domain by performing essential system administration tasks. The focus was on configuring and securing the network by creating and managing Organizational Units (OUs), as well as setting up and manipulating user accounts across multiple servers within the domain. This project emphasized the importance of domain security and efficient resource management within an Active Directory (AD) environment.
