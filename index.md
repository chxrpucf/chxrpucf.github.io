# Implementation Of File Encryption With The Hill Cipher

Project Overview:
I developed a C program that encrypts a plaintext file using the Hill cipher, a classic encryption technique that leverages linear algebra to transform data securely. The program reads a plaintext input file and a key file containing a matrix that defines the Hill cipher's encryption parameters.
